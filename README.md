<br /> **Prototype Board** <br />
The scope of the prototype board was simply to demonstrate all functionality for the the project in a compact protoboard configuration. this would assist in getting a better grasp on the final boards size and placement for the housing. By developing this board the team also achieved a better understanding on how these two microphones function and can leverage that knowledge for the final prototype. <br />
