## Project Requirements
<br /> **Functional Requirements** <br />
- As for technical functionality, the device must capture the user's voice intensity and
compute the error of that intensity to the ambient environment to gauge an appropriate
target level for the user to reach when communicating with others.
- The device will have a sleep mode where the vibratory motor does not initialize unless
it detects the user attempting to speak. Upon detection of the user's voice, it will
compute the error in real time and vibrate rapidly when the user's voice is low to
encourage a louder response and softly when the user's voice is loud to encourage a
quieter response.
- Users can adjust the system's haptic sensitivity. The system must capture ambient noise
and the user's vocal intensity. The system must compare ambient noise to user vocal
intensity to determine appropriate haptic feedback.

<br /> **Performance requirements** <br />

- Response time: The delay between sensing the audio and output feedback must be as
small as possible (in the order of microseconds). Huge delays cause confusion and false
interpretation for the user.
- Filtering: The background noise must be filtered properly to separate the audio signal
from the noise.
- Adaptability: The device must be capable of adapting to different surroundings and
adjusting its sensitivity according to those surroundings.
- Weight: The prototype must be light, as the user must be able to wear it for longer
periods. The size of the prototype can be reduced by optimizing the design parameters
without compromising the basic functionality of the system.
- Appearance and Visibility: The device must blend in with the body and stay hidden
under the userâ€™s clothes.
- Communication: The data communication between components must be fast and
error-free.
- Protection: The device must be protected from dust and liquids as per the IP54
standard.

<br /> **Usability Requirements** <br />
- Discreteness Requirement: The device should be discrete, allowing the user to
maintain privacy and avoid unwanted attention.
- Justification: If the device is too noticeable (i.e., a hearing aid), the user might avoid
wearing it due to its appearance. Having a discrete product will allow the user to wear
it comfortably and not have to worry about unwanted attention while gaining the
benefits of the device.
- Accessibility Requirement: The device should be accessible for users with
disabilities, including those with motor and auditory impairments.
- Justification: Individuals diagnosed with Parkinson's disease commonly experience a
symptom that affects their fine motor control. As a result, the device must be designed
to be accessible and easy to use to accommodate these symptoms.

## Prototype Board
The scope of the prototype board was simply to demonstrate all functionality for the the project in a compact protoboard configuration. this would assist in getting a better grasp on the final boards size and placement for the housing. By developing this board the team also achieved a better understanding on how these two microphones function and can leverage that knowledge for the final prototype. <br />
<br />
Before jumping into board construction, every component was tested individually as a subsystem. Once that was completed, a rough schematic was drawn up and verified before proceeding with board fabrication. <br />

/*
This project consisted of several counter variables as listed below.
These counter variables were utilized to guage the level of noise from each microphone as a voltage.
The team and I did not convert the microphone voltage to a straight decibel reading.
By using ranges and these counters we were able to isolate some noise.

## Initalizing Functions

```c
/*
  motorFeedback fnc
  
  Function takes the ambient low, ambient normal, ambient high, low, normal, and high counts from the data processing section and determines which the error. 
  this function uses a simple P controller with a gain of 3 to determine if the user is in a low or high range of tolerance.
  Once the user has been determined to be high or low it will provide haptic feedback to the user from the DC motor in either a long pulse or short pulse respectively.
  No feedback if user is in normal range.
